        A volunteer project as part of my academics at Western Sydney University
        which involved contributing to the IBM Watson Astronomy Assistant app.
        The app was built in React Native and would provide a IM like interface
        where users could interface with the IBM Watson API to gather real-time
        astronomy related information with photo integration and other forms of
        media.
        <br />
        <br /> My contributions involved accessibility features such as TTS,
        Dictation and various themes for vision impaired users. The app was
        presented to a team of IBM Chicago engineers who were overall impressed
        with the teams efforts.
